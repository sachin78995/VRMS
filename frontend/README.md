# VRMS Frontend

This is a minimal React frontend (Vite) for the Vehicle Registration and Licensing System.

Quick start

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default the frontend points to `http://localhost:5000` for the backend API. You can change that by setting `VITE_API_URL` in a `.env` file at the project root inside the `frontend` folder.
